Amazon, Pay is good but not worth the asks made from IT and how they are treated. Their health benefits are good and their career choice is helpful to start a new career.

You work long hours and not as many breaks as you would like or need at times. Poor management and it's difficult to get a hold of someone when there's a problem that needs fixing. There are also bad managers that are rude and do not care about the feelings of their associates. The company advertises peak season as the long hours and hard push but it really happens routinely throughout the year.,"All Amazon teams and businesses, from Prime delivery to AWS, are guided by four key tenets: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.  

We are driven by the excitement of building technologies, inventing products, and providing services that transform the way our customers live their lives and run their businesses."," Pay is good but not worth the asks made from IT and how they are treated.

You can learn so much from VMware and give back to charities while still enjoying a good work-life balance. Incredible culture and great at building work. Great for people really into coding and those who don't like much customer face-to-face dealings. Pay is good but you cannot spend as you don't know when your job will be gone.   Poor management and HR which is not helpful. Some managers have been in the role too long and won’t move as they wouldn't survive elsewhere. Annual layoffs at the beginning of each year leave you uneasy wondering if you will have a job. Upper management is bad which creates hierarchy. Mediocre middle management. VMware, a leading provider of multi-cloud services for all apps, was acquired by Broadcom Inc. on November 22, 2023.

India’s unorganized retail represents a c.$800bn+ Target Addressable Market (TAM), which is 80-85% of the overall retail sector.

This growth is expected to be led by consumers who are transitioning directly from unorganized trade to e-Commerce, especially those in the rising middle class of India. Meesho’s differentiated business model focuses on the underserved small sellers and value-first consumers.

The company provides sellers with a range of industry-first benefits such as zero commission and the lowest shipping cost. Over 1.4 million sellers are registered on Meesho, growing their business by tapping the company’s massive customer base, state-of-the-art tech infrastructure, pan-India logistics at the lowest cost through third-party logistics providers in an ‘Everyday Lowest Cost’ channel for sellers.
With ~80% of Meesho’s 140 million annual transacting customers coming from tier 2+ cities and towns, the company has been instrumental in bringing new-to-e-commerce users online.

With a strong value proposition of Everyday Lowest Prices, the platform hosts one of the largest selection of unique products (>65% product listings are unique to Meesho).
Meesho has so far raised ~$1.1 billion and was valued at c.$5 billion in its last round of funding, making it one of India’s most well capitalized growth names in the consumer internet space. It was also the first Indian startup to secure funding from Meta (Facebook).
