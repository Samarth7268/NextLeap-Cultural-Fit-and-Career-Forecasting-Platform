NextLeap – Cultural Fit and Career Forecasting Platform
NextLeap is a web-based platform designed to empower individuals to identify culturally aligned companies and forecast optimal career paths based on their unique values, preferences, and skillsets. At its core, the platform employs TF-IDF-based semantic similarity scoring to match users with organizations whose publicly stated missions, workplace values, and team cultures most closely resonate with user input. This allows users not only to find jobs but to find purpose-aligned careers.

To go beyond static recommendations, we integrated a Deep Q-Learning agent that dynamically learns and simulates user career trajectories. This reinforcement learning model enables the system to predict and optimize long-term growth paths, taking into account both short-term fit and long-term success. By combining natural language processing, machine learning, and behavioral modeling, NextLeap offers a personalized career navigator that reimagines how job seekers explore professional opportunities—prioritizing cultural resonance, personal growth, and strategic career planning.
